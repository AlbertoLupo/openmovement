00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Open Movement AX3 is a tri-axial accelerometer logger,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
capable of recording raw accelerometry data for 14 days at 100 Hz.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At the heart of the device is a 16g MEMS accelerometer,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
sampled by a low-power, 16-bit microprocessor.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The data is recorded to a 512MB NAND flash memory,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
supplemented by temperature and light measurements.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A micro USB connection is used for communication,
and recharging of the lithium polymer battery.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Encapsulated within a polycarbonate puck, the modular design 
ensures the AX3 is suitable for a variety of mounting options.
